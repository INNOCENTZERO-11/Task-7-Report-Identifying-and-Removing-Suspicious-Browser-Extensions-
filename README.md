Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
Objective
This task aimed to enhance understanding of browser security by identifying and removing potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions. The goal was to learn how to actively manage browser add-ons to mitigate security risks.

Tools Used
Google Chrome (or Firefox)

Steps Performed
Accessed Extension Manager: Navigated to the browser's extension/add-ons management page.

Reviewed Installed Extensions: Examined all active extensions for familiarity and purpose.

Inspected Permissions & Reviews: Checked permissions requested by each extension and researched unfamiliar ones for user reviews and potential security concerns.

Identified & Removed Suspicious/Unused Extensions: Based on permission analysis and online research, identified and uninstalled extensions that were suspicious, excessive in permissions, or no longer needed.

Restarted Browser: Relaunched the browser to observe any performance improvements.

Researched Malicious Extensions: Explored how various malicious extensions can compromise user data and browser integrity.

Documented Findings: Recorded the process and outcomes in a detailed report (not part of this README but submitted separately).

Findings & Actions Taken
Identified Extensions:

"Random Search Helper" - flagged for broad permissions and suspicious behavior.

"PDF Converter Pro" - flagged for broad permissions and being rarely used.

"Old Games Hub" - flagged as an unknown and likely accidental installation.

Removed Extensions: All identified extensions ("Random Search Helper", "PDF Converter Pro", "Old Games Hub") were successfully removed.

Performance Impact: Noted a slight improvement in browser responsiveness and a reduction in unwanted pop-ups after removal.

Learning Outcome
This task significantly improved my understanding of browser security best practices, the importance of reviewing extension permissions, and the potential threats posed by malicious or unnecessary browser add-ons. It emphasized the need for regular maintenance of installed extensions to ensure a secure browsing environment.
